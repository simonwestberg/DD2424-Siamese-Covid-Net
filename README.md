# Siamese-COVID-Net

In this project we implement a siamese convolutional neural network based on the COVID-Net architecture (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-76550-z) for classification of x-ray images of lungs infected with COVID-19. The project was done as part of the course DD2424 at KTH. The report detailing our method and findings can be found [here](report.pdf).
